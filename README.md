# Aspect Star

## Introduction

A 2D action game inspired by classic NES and PC games of the 80's, written in C# using the Monogame framework.

## Gameplay

Gameplay is designed to be approachable without much explanation. New concepts are introduced via stage design.

Your character can shoot bullets the same aspect as her. However, enemies can only be destroyed with bullets of the same aspect as them. The goal of each stage is to destroy all enemies, and thus progress to the next stage. By using the colored panels, you can change your and the enemies aspects.

There are nine stages, divided into three worlds of three stages each.

## Controls

Arrow keys control, space bar shoots, and enter key pauses. The motion and shoot keys can be set in-game in the options menu, but the menu will always use the arrow keys for navigation.
